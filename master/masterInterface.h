/// The MasterServerInterface is the RPC interface to the TNL example Master Server.
/// The default Master Server tracks a list of public servers and allows clients
/// to query for them based on different filter criteria, including maximum number of players,
/// region codes, game or mission type, and others.
///
/// When a client wants to initiate a connection with a server listed by the master, it
/// can ask the Master Server to arranage a connection.  The masterclient example that
/// ships with TNL demonstrates a client/server console application that uses the Master
/// Server to arrange connections between a client and a server instance.
///
/// Client/Server programs using the Master Server for server listing should create
/// a subclass of MasterServerInterface named "MasterServerConnection", and override
/// all of the RPC methods that begin with m2c, as they signify master to client messages.
/// RPC methods can be overridden with the TNL_DECLARE_RPC_OVERRIDE and TNL_IMPLEMENT_RPC_OVERRIDE methods.

// Notes from CE: To create a new master-client RPC, first declare that event in
// masterInterface.h, and create a stub in masterInterface.cpp.  Since these files
// are compiled into both the master server and individual clients, this will create
// a consistent function declaration in each program.
//
// If the RPC is to be executed on the master, then use the TNL_DECLARE_RPC_OVERRIDE
// macro in main.cpp in the master folder to override the stub and provide the
// actual code to be run.  Do not use TNL_IMPLEMENT_RPC_OVERRIDE.
//
// If the RPC will be executed on the client, then declare the
// TNL_DECLARE_RPC_OVERRIDE macro to declare the function in masterConnection.h, and
// use the TNL_IMPLEMENT_RPC_OVERRIDE macro to write the actual code in
// masterConnection.cpp.
