-- Joseph Weizenbaum's classic Eliza ported to Bitfighter
-- by Chris Eykamp
-- This program is hereby placed into PUBLIC DOMAIN
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- HOW TO USE
-- * This program is for recreational purposes only. :-)
-- * Add eliza.bot to any existing level file
-- * It is probably best to only add one eliza.bot to a given level
-- * Type away!
-- * Eliza recognizes one line of input only (if you are typing very
--   long lines, please consider seeing a real person.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Original ELIZA paper:
--   ELIZA--A Computer Program For the Study of Natural Language
--   Communication Between Man and Machine,
--   Joseph Weizenbaum, 1966, Communications of the ACM Volume 9,
--   Number 1 (January 1966): 36-35.
--   URL: http://i5.nyu.edu/~mm64/x52.9265/january1966.html
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A copy of the original BASIC source of this Lua version of ELIZA can
-- be found at Josep Subirana's ELIZA download page.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- NOTES
-- * Modifications made to fit the program into Bitfighter...
-- * For historical accuracy, functionality is more-or-less identical,
--   as is the use of an all upper-case alphabet for output.
-- * There is really no point extending this program. Many other more
--   advanced Eliza-type programs exist. Good candidates for porting are
--   EMACS' doctor.el and Perl's Chatbot-Eliza.
-- * One difference is keyword are matched by iterating through a hash
--   array, so matching order will be different from initialization order.
-- * In order to avoid keeping any internal state, this Eliza does not
--   remember your name.
-- * Input is now case-insensitive.
-- * The original used backticks for apostrophes, this was fixed.
-- * A couple of spelling mistakes in strings and comments fixed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Eliza main routine, processes user input
-- * Input is case insensitive. No punctuation except apostrophes,
--   as in: don't you're i'm i've you've.
