@luaclass Timer
@brief    Trigger one-time or recurring scheduled events.
@descr    %Timer is a utility class that makes it easier to manage timing periodic or delayed events. 
          The timer code is based on a very nice library written by Haywood Slap.

A timer object that can be used to schedule arbitrary events to be executed at some time in the future. 
All times are given in milliseconds.

@details There are four basic timer functions:
@code 
   -- Execute the event once in 'delay' ms
   Timer:scheduleOnce(event, delay)
    
   -- Execute the event repeatedly, every 'delay' ms
   Timer:scheduleRepeating(event, delay)  
    
   -- Execute the event every 'delay' ms while event returns true
   Timer:scheduleRepeatWhileTrue(event, delay)  
    
   -- Remove all pending events from the timer's queue
   Timer:clear()
@endcode

%Timer Events

The 'event' used can either be the name a function, a table that contains a function named 'run', or a bit of arbitrary Lua code.  These events
are distinct from the Bitfighter-generated events documented elsewhere.

Any Lua function can be called by a %Timer.

Examples:
@code
   function onLevelStart()
      -- Runs the code contained in the string after five seconds. 
      -- Note that the string here is in quotes.
      Timer:scheduleOnce("logprint(\"Once!\")", 5 * 1000)   
    
      -- Runs the "always" function every 30 seconds
      Timer:scheduleRepeating(always, 30 * 1000)            
    
      -- Runs "run" method of maybe every two seconds
      -- until method returns false
      Timer:scheduleRepeatWhileTrue(maybe, 2 * 1000)        
   end                                                  
    
   -- Standard function
   function always()
      logprint("Timer called always")
   end
    
   -- Table: run method will be called
   maybe = {
      count = 3
      run = function(self)
         logprint("Count down " .. self.count)
         self.count = self.count - 1
         return self.count > 0
      end
   }
@endcode

When using a table as an "event" the first parameter to the run function should always be a
parameter named "self".  The "self" parameter can be used to access the other fields in the table,
that is, the "self" parameter will refer to  the table that contains  the run function. If you do
not need to refer to any of the other fields in the table then you do not need to include the self
parameter.
