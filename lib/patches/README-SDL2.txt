 - Modification of upstream Xcode project to add a 'Release-10.4' configuration that will build i386 and ppc universal library.  This can be joined with the x86_64 build ('Release' configuration) to form a 3-architecture FAT library.  Use 'lipo' like this to do it:
   lipo -create -output SDL2 Release-10.4/SDL2.framework/Versions/A/SDL2 Release/SDL2.framework/Versions/A/SDL2
